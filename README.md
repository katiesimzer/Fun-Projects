# Fun-Projects

This is a place where I am going to put any kind of fun interest projects that I do.

## Counting Bikes
This project was inspired by seeing the cyclists using the REV St Denis, as well as the bike counter that I often pass in front of Laurier metro station. Using Montreal's open data for bike counters and Environment and Climate Change Canada's historical station data, I decided to see how strong the correlation was between the number of bikes counted and the maximum or minimum daily temperature.

Due to a change in the format of the bike data, I used 4 years (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022) of data to complete my analysis.
